        <p>
         I'm Vipul Bhatt, a dedicated and passionate final-year B.Tech Computer Science student 
         at Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun. I completed my schooling at 
         St. Don Bosco Sr. Sec. School, and I’ve always been driven by a deep interest in
          web development—creating visually appealing, responsive, and functional web experiences.</p>
        
        <p>To complement my development skills, I actively engage in problem-solving and 
          competitive programming. I’m proud to be a 4-star coder on HackerRank and currently 
          hold the 15th rank in my institute on GeeksforGeeks, reflecting my consistent dedication 
          to sharpening my coding abilities.

        My curiosity in emerging technologies recently led me to explore Generative AI. I developed
        a project that leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to assist in medical diagnosis, particularly 
        predicting Type 2 Diabetes from clinical text data—showcasing the real-world impact of AI in healthcare.

        Beyond academics and projects, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about industry trends,
        and continuously improving my skills. I believe in balancing productivity with personal growth, 
        and I’m committed to staying updated with the evolving landscape of tech.

        As I move forward, my goal is to build user-centric digital solutions that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and impactful.
